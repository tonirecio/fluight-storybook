# PassengersFilter

The `PassengersFilter` component is designed to manage and display passenger selection for a flight. It allows users to dynamically add, update, and remove passenger types and counts, while enforcing specific rules for valid passenger configurations.

## TypeScript Types

### `passengerData`

The passengerData type represents the structure of a passenger entry:

```typescript
interface passengerData {
  id: number; // Unique identifier for the passenger entry
  number: number; // Number of passengers of this type
  type: string; // Type of passenger (e.g., 'ADT', 'CHD', 'CMP')
}
```

## Features

1. **Dynamic Passenger Management**:

   - Allows users to dynamically add, update, and remove passenger types and counts.
   - Supports up to 9 total passengers and a maximum of 3 passenger types (`ADT`, `CHD`, `CMP`).

2. **Passenger Type Selection**:

   - Users can select passenger types (`ADT` for Adult, `CHD` for Child, `CMP` for Companion).
   - Enforces rules such as requiring at least one `ADT` or `CMP` when a `CHD` is present.

3. **Callback Support**:

   - Triggers the `onPassengersSelected` callback whenever the passenger data is updated, passing the updated array of `passengerData` objects.

4. **Add and Remove Passenger Types**:

   - Includes a button to add new passenger types, styled using `StyledButtonPlus` and displaying a `PlusIcon`.
   - Allows users to remove passenger types, with validation to ensure valid configurations.

5. **Validation Rules**:

   - Ensures that the total number of passengers does not exceed 9.
   - Prevents adding duplicate passenger types.
   - Displays an alert if a `CHD` is selected without an accompanying `ADT` or `CMP`.

6. **Keyboard and Mouse Interaction**:
   - Supports keyboard interactions for incrementing and decrementing passenger counts using arrow keys.
   - Users can interact with the component using both keyboard and mouse.

## Component Behavior

1. **Passenger Initialization**:

   - The component initializes with a single passenger type (`ADT`) and a count of 1.
   - The `selectors` state tracks the count of passengers for each type.
   - The `types` state tracks the passenger types (`ADT`, `CHD`, `CMP`).

2. **Adding Passenger Types**:

   - The "Add Passenger" button allows users to add new passenger types.
   - New passenger types are added in the order of `ADT`, `CMP`, and `CHD`.
   - The button is disabled if the total number of passengers reaches 9 or if all 3 types are already selected.

3. **Updating Passenger Counts**:

   - Users can increment or decrement the count of passengers for each type using the input field or arrow keys.
   - The total number of passengers cannot exceed 9.

4. **Removing Passenger Types**:

   - Users can remove a passenger type using the delete button.
   - Validation ensures that at least one `ADT` or `CMP` is present if a `CHD` is selected.
   - If removing a passenger type violates the rules, an alert is displayed using the `showAlert` function.

5. **Callback Execution**:

   - The `onPassengersSelected` callback is triggered whenever the `selectors` or `types` state is updated, passing the updated passenger data to the parent component.

6. **Validation and Alerts**:

   - The `showAlert` function displays a styled alert message if the user attempts an invalid configuration (e.g., removing all adults when a child is present).

7. **Keyboard and Mouse Interaction**:
   - Users can interact with the component using both keyboard and mouse.
   - The input fields support arrow key interactions for incrementing and decrementing counts.
