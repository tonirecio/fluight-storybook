# SegmentsFilter

The `SegmentsFilter` component is designed to manage and display a list of flight segments. It allows users to dynamically add, update, and delete flight segments using the `SegmentFilter` component.

## Props

### `SegmentsFilterProps`

| Prop Name            | Type                                 | Required | Default Value       | Description                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dataTestId`         | `string`                             | No       | `'segments-filter'` | The `data-testid` attribute for the main container, useful for testing. |
| `onSegmentsSelected` | `(segments: segmentEntry[]) => void` | No       | `undefined`         | A callback function triggered whenever the list of segments is updated. |

## TypeScript Types

### `location`

The `location` type represents a location object with the following structure:

```typescript
type location = {
  code: string; // The airport code (e.g., "JFK").
  city: string; // The city name (e.g., "New York").
  country: string; // The country name (e.g., "USA").
  airportName: string; // The name of the airport (e.g., "John F. Kennedy International").
};
```

### `segmentEntry`

The `segmentEntry` type represents a flight segment object with the following structure:

```typescript
interface segmentEntry {
  id: number; // Unique identifier for the segment
  origin: location | null; // Origin location of the flight
  destination: location | null; // Destination location of the flight
  date: Date | null; // Date of the flight
  time: Date | null; // Time of the flight
}
```

## Features

1. **Dynamic Segment Management**:

   - Allows users to dynamically add, update, and delete flight segments.
   - Each segment is represented by a `SegmentFilter` component.

2. **Default Segment Initialization**:

   - Initializes the first segment with default values using the `defaultSegment` object.
   - New segments inherit the destination of the previous segment as their origin.

3. **Callback Support**:

   - Triggers the `onSegmentsSelected` callback whenever the list of segments is updated, passing the updated array of `segmentEntry` objects.

4. **Add Segment Button**:

   - Includes a button to add new segments.
   - The button is styled using `StyledAddFlightIcon` and displays a `PlusIcon`.

5. **Delete Segment Functionality**:

   - Allows users to delete segments using the delete button in the `SegmentFilter` component.
   - The delete button is disabled for the first segment to ensure at least one segment remains.

6. **Segment Updates**:

   - The `updateSegment` function allows individual segments to be updated dynamically when changes are made in the `SegmentFilter` component.

7. **Keyboard and Mouse Interaction**:

   - Users can interact with the component using both keyboard and mouse.
   - The "Add Segment" button and delete buttons are clickable and accessible.

8. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Designed to integrate seamlessly with the `SegmentFilter` component and other related components in the application.

## Component Behavior

1. **Segment Initialization**:

   - The component initializes with a single segment using the `defaultSegment` object.
   - The `segments` state is an array of `segmentEntry` objects, representing the list of flight segments.
   - Each segment includes default values for origin, destination, date, and time.

2. **Adding Segments**:

   - The "Add Segment" button allows users to add new segments.
   - When clicked, a new segment is added to the `segments` state.
   - The new segment inherits the destination of the last segment as its origin.
   - The `nextSegmentId` state is incremented to ensure unique IDs for each segment.

3. **Updating Segments**:

   - The `updateSegment` function updates a specific segment in the `segments` state when changes are made in the `SegmentFilter` component.
   - The updated segment is passed to the `onSegmentSelected` callback, allowing the parent component to track changes.

4. **Deleting Segments**:

   - The `handleDeleteSegment` function removes a segment from the `segments` state when the delete button is clicked.
   - The delete button is disabled for the first segment to ensure at least one segment remains in the list.

5. **Callback Execution**:

   - The `onSegmentsSelected` callback is triggered whenever the `segments` state is updated, passing the updated list of segments to the parent component.

6. **Dynamic Segment Rendering**:

   - The component maps over the `segments` state to render a `SegmentFilter` component for each segment.
   - Each `SegmentFilter` is passed props such as `index`, `isDeleteButtonEnabled`, and `onSegmentSelected`.

7. **Keyboard and Mouse Interaction**:

   - Users can interact with the component using both keyboard and mouse.
   - The "Add Segment" button and delete buttons are clickable and accessible.

8. **Error Handling**:
   - If no segments are present, the component ensures that at least one default segment is initialized.
   - The component gracefully handles missing or invalid segment data by displaying placeholders or empty fields for origin, destination, date, or time.
