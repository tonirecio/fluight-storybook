## Component Behavior

1. **Click Interaction**:

   - When the delete button is clicked, the `onItemDeleted` callback is triggered (if provided).
   - The `itemCode` is passed as a parameter to the callback, allowing the parent component to handle the deletion logic.

2. **Testing**:
   - The `dataTestId` prop allows developers to assign a unique test ID to the component for testing purposes.
   - The delete button includes a `data-testid` attribute in the format `removeButton-{itemCode}` for precise testing.
