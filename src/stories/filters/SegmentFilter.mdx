# SegmentFilter

The `SegmentFilter` component is designed to manage and display flight segment data. It integrates the `SegmentData` component to allow users to select origin and destination locations, as well as the date and time of the flight. Additionally, it provides functionality to delete a segment and dynamically update segment labels.

| `dataTestId`            | `string`                          | No       | `'segment-filter'` | The `data-testid` attribute for the main container, useful for testing.                                    |
| `onSegmentSelected`     | `(segment: segmentEntry) => void` | No       | `undefined`        | A callback function triggered when the segment data is updated (e.g., origin, destination, date, or time). |
| `onDeleteSegment`       | `(id: number) => void`            | No       | `undefined`        | A callback function triggered when the delete button is clicked, passing the segment ID.                   |

## TypeScript Types

### `location`

The `location` type represents a location object with the following structure:

```typescript
type location = {
  code: string; // The airport code (e.g., "JFK").
  city: string; // The city name (e.g., "New York").
  country: string; // The country name (e.g., "USA").
  airportName: string; // The name of the airport (e.g., "John F. Kennedy International").
};
```

### `segmentEntry`

The `segmentEntry` type represents a flight segment object with the following structure:

```typescript
interface segmentEntry {
  id: number; // Unique identifier for the segment
  origin: location | null; // Origin location of the flight
  destination: location | null; // Destination location of the flight
  date: Date | null; // Date of the flight
  time: Date | null; // Time of the flight
}
```

## Features

1. **Dynamic Segment Labels**:

   - Displays the origin and destination city names in the format `Origin City - Destination City`.
   - Updates dynamically when the user selects a new origin or destination.
   - Defaults to `"From"` and `"To"` if no origin or destination is provided.

2. **Integration with `SegmentData`**:

   - Uses the `SegmentData` component to manage origin, destination, date, and time selection.
   - Supports callbacks for each selection (`onOriginLocationSelected`, `onDestinationLocationSelected`, `onDateSelected`, `onTimeSelected`).

3. **Delete Button**:

   - Includes a delete button to remove the segment.
   - The button can be enabled or disabled using the `isDeleteButtonEnabled` prop.
   - Triggers the `onDeleteSegment` callback when clicked, passing the segment ID.
   - Displays a gray-colored delete icon (`#808080`) when the button is disabled.

4. **Callback Support**:

   - Triggers `onSegmentSelected` whenever the user updates the segment data (origin, destination, date, or time).
   - Allows the parent component to track changes to the segment.

5. **Customizable Testing IDs**:

   - Includes `data-testid` attributes for the main container, delete button, and segment labels, making it easier to test the component.

6. **Error Handling**:

   - Gracefully handles missing or invalid segment data by displaying placeholders or empty fields for origin, destination, date, or time.

7. **Keyboard and Mouse Interaction**:

   - Supports both keyboard and mouse interactions for selecting locations, dates, and times.
   - The delete button is clickable and accessible for removing segments.

8. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Designed to integrate seamlessly with the `SegmentData` component and other related components in the application.

## Component Behavior

1. **Dynamic Segment Labels**:

   - The `SegmentFilter` component initializes the `segmentLabels` state with the origin and destination codes and cities from the `segment` prop.
   - If no origin or destination is provided, the labels default to `"From"` and `"To"`.
   - The labels update dynamically when the user selects a new origin or destination through the `SegmentData` component.

2. **Integration with `SegmentData`**:

   - The `SegmentData` component is used to manage the selection of origin, destination, date, and time.
   - When a selection is made, the corresponding callback (`onSegmentSelected`) is triggered, and the `segmentLabels` state is updated.
   - The `SegmentData` component also supports dynamic filtering of locations using the `onGetOriginData` and `onGetDestinationData` callbacks.

3. **Delete Button**:

   - The delete button is displayed if `isDeleteButtonEnabled` is `true`.
   - When clicked, the `onDeleteSegment` callback is triggered, passing the segment ID.
   - If the button is disabled, it is displayed in a gray color (`#808080`) and does not trigger any action.

4. **Callback Execution**:

   - The component triggers the following callbacks when user actions occur:
     - `onSegmentSelected`: Triggered whenever the user updates the segment data (origin, destination, date, or time).
     - `onDeleteSegment`: Triggered when the delete button is clicked, passing the segment ID.

5. **Error Handling**:

   - If no default values are provided for the segment, the component gracefully handles these cases by displaying placeholders or empty fields for origin, destination, date, or time.

6. **Keyboard and Mouse Interaction**:

   - Users can interact with the component using both keyboard and mouse.
   - The `SegmentData` component supports native browser functionality for input and selection.
