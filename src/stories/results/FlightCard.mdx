## Features

1. **Comprehensive Flight Details**:

   - Includes detailed information about the flight's origin and destination locations using the `location` interface.
   - Provides the flight code and aircraft type for identification.

2. **Operational Information**:

   - Contains details about the airline operating the flight through the `operatedBy` property, which uses the `carrier` interface.

3. **Time and Terminal Information**:

   - Includes structured data for both departure and arrival times and terminals.

4. **Reusable Structure**:

   - Designed to be used across multiple components, such as flight cards, itineraries, and flight comparison tools.

5. **Standardized Data Representation**:
   - Ensures consistent representation of flight segment data throughout the application.

## Component Behavior

1. **Data Representation**:

   - The `populatedFlightDetail` interface ensures that all flight segment-related data is consistently structured and includes all necessary fields.

2. **Integration**:

   - Used in components like `FlightCardFlightInformation` to display detailed flight segment information.
   - Supports dynamic rendering of flight details in itineraries, flight cards, and comparison tools.

3. **Time and Terminal Information**:

   - The `arrival` and `departure` properties provide structured data for displaying flight times and terminal information in a user-friendly format.

4. **Operational Details**:

   - The `operatedBy` property allows components to display the airline operating the flight, even if it differs from the marketing carrier.

5. **Reusability**:
   - The interface is designed to be reusable across various components, ensuring consistent data handling and display.
